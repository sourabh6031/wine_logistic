# wine_logistic
The Wine Recognition dataset is a classic benchmark dataset widely used in machine learning for classification tasks. It provides valuable insights into wine classification based on various chemical attributes.

The wine dataset contains the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in three different regions in Italy. Specifically, it includes 13 attributes derived from measurements of various constituents found in the wines. These attributes typically include factors like alcohol content, acidity levels, and concentrations of different chemical compounds such as phenols and flavonoids.

# Overview
This project explores classification using Scikit-Learn's Wine Dataset. The goal is to analyze and preprocess the data, apply different machine learning models, and optimize performance through feature selection and hyperparameter tuning.

# Approach
Data Analysis & Transformation: Performed in Jupyter Notebook.
Model Selection: Tested both Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
Feature Selection: Used feature importance to eliminate non-essential features and reduce model complexity.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Improved the base modelâ€™s performance on both the validation and test datasets.
# Key Findings
- Logistic Regression outperformed Random Forest, especially in linearly separable data.
- Feature selection and hyperparameter tuning significantly enhanced model performance.
